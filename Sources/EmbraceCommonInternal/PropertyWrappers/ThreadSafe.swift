/// A thread-safe wrapper for properties.
///
/// This property wrapper uses an `UnfairLock` (aka. wrapper around `os_unfair_lock`) to ensure that access
/// to the wrapped property is thread-safe.
/// You can use it to protect properties that might be accessed from multiple threads simultaneously.
///
///     class EmbraceClass {
///         @ThreadSafe var threadSafeProperty: Int = 0
///     }
///
/// Keep in mind that the underlying lock is "unfair", meaning that there's no guarantee about the order in which threads acquire the lock.
/// One thread might acquire the lock multiple times in a row while other threads are waiting.
///
/// - Important: Do not use this wrapper for recursive access patterns; it will deadlock.
/// - Note: This is similar to the `atomic` property attribute in Objective-C, it gives thread safe acccess to the
/// pointer, not the contents.
