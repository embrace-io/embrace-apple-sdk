    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - type: The class in which the method resides. The method to be swizzled **must belong to this class specifically**.
    ///   - selector: The selector for the instance method to be swizzled.
    ///   - implementationType: The expected function signature of the original method (use `@convention(c)`)
    ///   - blockImplementationType: The expected function signature of the new implementation block (use `@convention(block)`)
    ///   - block: A closure that accepts the original implementation as input (`implementationType.Type`) and provides the
    ///   new implementation (`blockImplementationType.Type`)
    ///
    /// - Important: This method only operates on methods explicitly declared in the specified class. If the method is inherited from a parent class, **it wont be swizzled**.
