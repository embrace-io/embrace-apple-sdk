## 6.5.0
*Oct 18th, 2024*
* Features
    * Removed `SwiftLint` from `Package.swift` as a dependency, which reduces the download size of our SDK and prevents dependency resolution conflicts.
    * For those consuming the SDK without an `appId`, `Embrace.Options` now includes the possibility to provide custom configuration (implementing `EmbraceConfigurable`).
* Fixes
    * Fixed a linking conflict issue affecting some users both with SPM and CocoaPods.
    * Implemented a fix to expose user customization methods (`userName`, `userEmail`, `userIdentifier`, and `clearUserProperties`) to Objective-C.
    * Fixed a bug that caused the `Span.Status` to be incorrect when exporting a session ended due to a crash.

## 6.4.2
*Oct 2nd, 2024*
* Fixes
    * Fixed crash in `URLSessionCaptureService`.
    * Fixed network body capture logs not being exported.

*Sep 26th, 2024*
* Features
    * Updated OpenTelemetry dependencies to v1.10.1.
* Fixes
    * Fixed logs not having resources from the session when being recovered during the SDK startup.
    * Fixed crash with the `gtm-session-fetcher` library.

## 6.4.0
*Sep 13th, 2024*
* Features
    * Added the option to use the SDK without an `appId` using `Embrace.Options`.
    * Introduced a new parameter in the `log` API: `stackTraceBehavior` to specify the behavior for automatically capturing stack traces within a log.
    * Added the capability to securely capture the body of network requests.
* Changes
    * Removed `-dynamic` targets from Swift Package Manager.
    * Discontinued capturing the screen resolution of devices.
* Fixes
    * Updated `GRDB` to the current latest version (`6.29.1`) to support Xcode 16.
    * Addressed issues related to our service for capturing Network Requests with the new concurrency system (aka. `async` / `await`).
    * Fixed a crash associated with being with another player proxying `URLSession`.
    * Resolved an issue that prevented proper forwarding of calls to the original delegate when swizzling `URLSession` due to a retention issue.
    * Corrected the public API `recordCompletedSpan` to set `Span.Status` consistently with other `end` methods.

## 6.3.0
*Aug 7th, 2024*
* Features
    * Added new public target: `EmbraceSemantics` to expose constants and attributes used to extend OTel Semantic Conventions
    * Added Cocoapods support
    * Added logic to link an emitted `LogRecord` to the active span context
    * Created new APIs for `W3C.traceparent` to be used to support manually instrumented network requests
* Changes
    * Update `Embrace` to expose `LogType` on the `log` method
    * Renamed `LogType.default` to `LogType.message`
    * Adds `MigrationService` in `EmbraceStorage` target to structure DB migrations that occur. Will perform migrations
during SDK setup if any are outstanding. Converted existing DB schema to be initialized using migrations.
* Fixes
    * Fixed the public `addPersona(persona: String, lifespan: MetadataLifespan)` method which wasn't properly forwarding the `lifespan`
    * Fixed a bug that caused a reentrancy issue with the database when persisting spans.

## 6.2.0

July 30th, 2024

**Features**

* Adds `PushNotificationCaptureService` to instrument notifications received using Apple's `UserNotifications` framework
* Adds `Embrace.lastRunEndState` method to retrieve an indication of how the previous start of the SDK finished
    * Provided values can be `unavailable, `crash`, and `cleanExit`
* Adds `CaptureServiceBuilder` to provide easier interface to setup/configure `CaptureService` instances
* Adds `Embrace.tracer(instrumentationName: String)` method to retrieve OpenTelemetry `Tracer`
    * This is useful for manual instrumentation using the `OpenTelemetryApi` directly
* Adds ability to set "User Personas" in the `MetadataHandler`
    * User Personas are great ways to tag users and identify commonalities
    * See `MetadataHandler+Personas` for interface definition

** Changes **
* Updates `TapCaptureService` with options to better control data capture
    * Allows you to ignore specific views by class, or to prevent coordinate capture
    * Optional `TapCaptureServiceDelegate` to have fine grained control over tap capture

** Fixes **
* Fixes bug that prevented user properties from being included on an Embrace session
* Cleanup of public interface and code level documentation

## 6.1.1

* Adds `WebViewCaptureService` to instrument `WKWebView` interactions
* Adds `EmbraceCrashlyticsSupport` target to read Crashlytics crash reports
* Adds "Internal Log" functionality to allow for logs to be created to observe SDK behavior/health
    * Will have attribute `emb.type = sys.internal` to differentiate from user logs (`emb.type = sys.log`)

** Changes **
* Updates upload of spans to the `v2/spans` endpoint
* Adds migration functionality to `EmbraceStorage` target
    * Updates SpanRecord table with `process_identifier` to better help Span recovery and recording of spans
